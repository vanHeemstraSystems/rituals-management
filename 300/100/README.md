# 100 - Rituals in NotePlan

**WARNING**: At the moment NotePlan does not synchronize between its Windows Web version and its [MacOS Web](app.noteplan.co) / iOS / macOS version. It is recommended to login with your Apple ID - on a Mac or iOS device (e.g. iPhone or iPad) as this will sync at least between a [MacOS Web version](app.noteplan.co) and an iOS / macOS version. In general, use NotePlan on a Mac, not on Windows for as long as this is an issue.
