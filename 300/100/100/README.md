# 100 - Levels

To be able to set different levels (e.g. Strategic, Tactial, Operational) in NotePlan follow these steps:

## 100 - Create the Base Note

1. Open [NotePlan](https://app.noteplan.co/). **Note**: Use ```Apple ID Sign In``` (**not** ```Email Sign In```), so it gets synchronized across devices.

2. Click "New Note"

3. Title the note: "Annual Ritual Tracking 2025". **Note**: Replace ```2025``` by the year that is relevant.

Links:
- Instead of using `@due(2025-01-15)`, or `>2025-01-15`, it is prefered to use `[[2025-01-15]]` as it will update the text on that date if the text in the note is changed as well as creating a backlink.
- It is recommended to link to dates at task level (e.g. ```Gather performance metrics```) rather than at list level (e.g. ```Preparation Phase```).

## 200 - Basic Structure

**Note**: Replace ```2025``` below by the year that is relevant.
