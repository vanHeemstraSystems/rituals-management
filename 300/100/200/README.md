# 200 - Program Increment Planning Events (PIPE)s

To be able to set plan following the Scaled Agile (SAfe) methodology in NotePlan follow these steps:

## 100 - Create the Base Note

1. Open [NotePlan](https://app.noteplan.co/). **Note**: Use ```Apple ID Sign In``` (**not** ```Email Sign In```), so it gets synchronized across devices.

2. Click "New Note"

3. Title the note: "2025 PI Planning Tracker". **Note**: Replace ```2025``` by the year that is relevant.

## 200 - Basic Structure

**Note**: Replace ```2025``` below by the year that is relevant.
