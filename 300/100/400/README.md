See also [NotePlan - Dashboard](https://github.com/biznachio/NotePlan-Dashboard) 

BizNachio uses NotePlan daily and in doing so discovered he was much more productive when he wasn't continually opening the app to focus on his next task. He envisioned having all the information available in NotePlan visible on his desktop. And since NotePlan keeps your information as plain text files in iCloud, we can use GeekTool script modules to create a dynamic dashboard.

The geeklets he's provided add three modules to your desktop. He collectivley refers to these modules as NotePlan Dashboard. The modules are: Calendar, Recent, and Tasks.

- **Calendar** displays current and next month calendars and a productivity "meter" to visualize your productivity over the past week.

- **Recent** displays your active, waiting, or delayed work based on time. This geeklet help you keeps all your notes in mind which lets you get caught up on projects you've forgotten about.

- **Tasks** shows you what's due today and iCal events and reminders.
