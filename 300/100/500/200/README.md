# 200 - Setup your Git Repository

We'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a Git Client.

1. On Mac and iOS, run NotePlan at least once, so the notes folder gets created.

2. Set the Sync on Mac and iOS inside NotePlan to "No Sync" in the preferences.

- On iPad inside NotePlan choose Settings. From Sync choose "Turn Off Sync".
- On Mac (Mini) inside NotePlan choose Preferences . From Sync choose "No Sync".

3. Open Finder at NotePlanâ€™s sync folder (```Macintosh HD > Users > [your user name] > Library > Containers > NotePlan 3 > Data > Library > Application Support > co.noteplan.NotePlan3```) and delete the directory named "co.noteplan.NotePlan3", backing up any files, if you already have some. **Note**: GitHub can't create a new repository in an existing folder.
