# 200 - Setup your Git Repository

We'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a Git Client.

1. On Mac and iOS, run NotePlan at least once, so the notes folder gets created.

2. Set the Sync on Mac and iOS inside NotePlan to "No Sync" in the preferences.

- On iPad inside NotePlan choose Settings. From Sync choose "Turn Off Sync".
- On Mac (Mini) inside NotePlan choose Preferences . From Sync choose "No Sync".
